# Practicing javascript and jest
This is a little practice focused on javascript and testing using a popular library by Facebook, Jest JS, this practice is working with Node JS.
In this practice I pretend to use the functionalities that Jest provides.

# String to results
It works easy, given a string via command line to excute the program, the string is processed to return the result of the operations given in the string
the string has to have some specifications, it's just admited '+', '-', '*' and '/' to operate as well as integer or decimal numbers only.

The purpoce is to validate the functionality of all scripts doing testing of them, in the "__TESTS__" folder you could find these testing scripts with Jest,
the basic idea of this is to evaluate the input and output of the functions given into a test suite provided by jest, using functions as toBe(), toStrictEqual() and toThrow() that help me to check is a value given is equal to a value returned or if the value given is exactly equal to a value returned as well as if a error controled is returned.
